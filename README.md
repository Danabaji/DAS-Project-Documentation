 # DAS-Documentation

This is where I started my Portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator 
 
 I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from MS Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building 

 ## Project Topic: E Commerce Sales Analysis  

 ### Project Overview   

 This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the e-commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions, which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gained and to know the best performance from our data

### Data Source
The primary source of Data used here is Data Sale.csv, and this is an open-source dataset that can be freely downloaded from an open-source online site such as Kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.
